# vendingMachine
Create CRUD API for Vending Machine Case

SETUP: 

1. Initialize the Go Project: First, make sure to initialize a Go module.
```
go mod init vending-machine
```

2. Install Mux: We'll use Gorilla Mux for routing.
```
go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
```


Explanation

Struct: 
  Item represents an item in the vending machine with Name and Price fields.

Endpoints:
  GET /items: Retrieves all items.
  GET /items/{name}: Retrieves a single item by its name.
  POST /items: Creates a new item after checking that the price denomination is valid.
  PUT /items/{name}: Updates an itemâ€™s details if it exists and if the new price is valid.
  DELETE /items/{name}: Deletes an item by name.

Validation: 
  isValidDenomination ensures that the price is either 2000 or 5000, as per the requirements.


Running the API

1. Save the code to a file, for example, main.go.
2. Run the API:
   ```
   go run main.go
   ```
3. Test the endpoints using curl or a tool like Postman.


Testing the API

For testing, you can use curl in the terminal or a tool like Postman.

Assume the API is running on http://localhost:8000.
